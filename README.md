# hello-world
Just me setting up my github account, nothing too special

Quick intro, my name is Emmanuel Jefferson and I've been building my own robots since age 14. I've always had a facination for all things mechanical and electrical; but the field I've found myself most captivated by is autonomous machines. 

Be it a self-driving car, factory robot, or automated computer vision system; if it moves and processes on its own I'm hooked. Within robotics, my specific inclination is machine learning and artificial intelligence. As processing hardware advances, my goal is to be part of the revolution that advances computers to the level of human-like problem solving. Done right such creations will always augment, not replace, their creators.
